# Copywriting Guide: The "Motion Design SaaS" Style

This guide defines how to write scripts for our videos. The goal is to transform "Dry Product Documentation" into "Punchy, Emotional Motion Design Copy".

## The "Less is More" Philosophy
In motion design videos, **nobody reads long sentences**.
*   ❌ "Our software allows you to connect with experts in real-time to solve your problems." (Too long, boring)
*   ✅ "Connect with experts." (Good)
*   ✅ "The answer. Instantly." (Better - Emotional)

## Voice & Tone
*   **Direct**: Use imperatives ("Ask anything", "Stop searching").
*   **Confident**: Avoid "Try to", "Maybe". Use "Is", "Will", "Done".
*   **Rhythmic**: Use short bursts. One thought per screen.

## The Script Structure (Template)

### 1. The Hook (Phase: Problem/Agitation)
*   **Goal**: Stop the scroll. Identify the pain immediately.
*   **Format**: A provocative question or a strong statement about the "Status Quo".
*   **Examples**:
    *   "Et si vous mettiez fin aux questions sans réponses ?"
    *   "Tired of managing spreadsheets?"
    *   "Data should be simple."

### 2. The Reveal (Phase: Solution)
*   **Goal**: Introduce the product as the obvious magic solution.
*   **Format**: Short name reveal or 3-word promise.
*   **Examples**:
    *   "ExpertFlow."
    *   "La réponse est à portée de main."
    *   "Finally. Clarity."

### 3. The "Magic" (Phase: Demo)
*   **Goal**: Show, don't just tell. The text should support the visual action, not describe it.
*   **Format**: Very minimal text. Let the UI breathe.
*   **Examples**:
    *   "Posez n'importe quelle question." (While showing typing)
    *   "It just works." (While showing automation)
    *   "Drag. Drop. Done."

### 4. The Deep Dive (Phase: Benefits)
*   **Goal**: Highlight 1-2 key differentiators.
*   **Format**: "Adjective + Noun" or "Benefit > Feature".
*   **Examples**:
    *   "Plus qu'un chatbot."
    *   "Toujours à jour."
    *   "Bank-grade security."

### 5. The Outro (Phase: CTA)
*   **Goal**: Imprint the brand.
*   **Format**: 3 words or a final tagline.
*   **Examples**:
    *   "Simple. Fast. Secure."
    *   "Start today."

## How to Translate Features into Copy
**Input (Product Doc)**: "The application features a real-time notification system that alerts you whenever an expert answers your question."
**Translation**:
1.  *Identify Core Value*: Speed, Expert connection.
2.  *Draft 1*: Get notified instantly by experts.
3.  *Motion Design Polish*:
    *   Screen 1: "Un expert est notifié"
    *   Screen 2: "Et répond à votre question"

**Input (Product Doc)**: "We use AI to index all your documentation so the knowledge base grows automatically."
**Translation**:
1.  *Identify Core Value*: Growth, Automation.
2.  *Motion Design Polish*: "Une mémoire qui grandit avec vous."
